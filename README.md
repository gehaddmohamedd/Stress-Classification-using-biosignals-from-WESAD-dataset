ðŸ“– Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline to classify stress and non-stress states based on Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals recorded from the chest, using data from the WESAD dataset. The pipeline includes preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, class balancing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

Motivation
Stress detection is a vital area of research in health monitoring and affective computing. Accurate automatic classification can enable real-time interventions and improve well-being. This project explores how well chest EDA signals alone can be used for stress classification.
